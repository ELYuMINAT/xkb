Colegrammer - Colemak for the (shell) programmer
https://github.com/repolho/xkb

This layout inherits the great letter key arrangement from Colemak
(http://colemak.com) (by Shai Coleman) while trying to fix the mess which is the
symbol key arrangement from Qwerty. Furthermore, it also tries to prevent the
user from ever having to move his hands to reach for a key.

The idea that a programmer will type numbers less often than symbols was
imported from Programmer Dvorak (http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) (by
Roland Kaufman), but Colegrammer tries to accomplish this in quite a different
manner. Instead of level 2 (shifted) positions, the numbers were arranged in
group 2 (mod3ed) positions, on the right hand alone, to prevent the constant
jumping between the right and left shift keys you get with ProDvo. On the left
side, group 2 got the arrow and navigation keys.
