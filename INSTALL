XKB
---

To install locally (no root privileges):

Copy the xkb file to a handy location (notice you need to place it inside a
directory called symbols)

$ mkdir -p "$HOME/.xkb/symbols"
$ mv colegrammer "$HOME/.xkb/symbols"

Now load it with

$ setxkbmap -I"$HOME/.xkb" colegrammer -print | xkbcomp -w 0 -I"$HOME/.xkb" - "$DISPLAY" && xset r 66 -r 21 -r 49 -r 135

System wide installation:

Copy this file to your X11/xkb/symbols/ dir (mine is
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/), and run

$ setxkbmap colegrammer && xset r 66 -r 21 -r 49 -r 135

LINUX CONSOLE
-------------

Copy the map file to your system's console keymaps folder (mine is
/usr/share/keymaps/i386), and set it to be your keymap as root. Check your
distro's documentation for help.
